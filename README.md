# Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning: DonorsChoose Dataset Prediction

Description:

as part of my seminar presentation on ensemble methods in machine learning, based on the DonorsChoose dataset from Kaggle. During my Masters in AI at MSIS, MAHE, I explored ensemble techniques, focusing on Gradient Boosting (GBDT).

Project Highlights:

1. **Objective:** This project demonstrates the effectiveness of GBDT, an ensemble method, for predicting the approval status of DonorsChoose project proposals.

2. **Data Analysis:** Explore and preprocess the DonorsChoose dataset to extract insights and prepare it for modeling.

3. **Model:** The project primarily employs Gradient Boosting to build the prediction model.

4. **Performance:** The model achieves a test AUC of around 0.7, indicating its predictive power.

5. **Codebase:** Access the project's code, including data preprocessing and GBDT implementation.

6. **Dataset:** Kaggle

Explore this repository to learn about ensemble methods, specifically GBDT, and their application to real data. Feedback and contributions are welcome.
